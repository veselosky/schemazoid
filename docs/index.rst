schemazoid documentation
======================================
Schemazoid is a library used for modeling data, especially data that is
transferred across the wire in some structured format such as JSON. Schemazoid
aims to make it easy to use such data in Python applications.

The main component of schemazoid is the micromodels framework. Its goal is to
simplify the process of modeling data structures, such as dictionaries from a
JSON API, into full Python objects. It also assists with the reverse
transformation, converting Python objects to a JSON-serializable dictionary.
